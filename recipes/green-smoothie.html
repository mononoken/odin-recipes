  <h2>A refreshing smoothie using spinach and fruits.</h2>
  <p>This is a simple smoothie recipe that I make regularly. It is convenient 
      to make and makes me feel like I am getting enough vegetables and fruits 
      on a daily basis. <strong>Note that you will need a blender to create 
      this recipe.</strong> I use a Certified Reconditioned Vitamix blender 
      that has a 64-ounce capacity. If your blender is smaller, ratio 
      appropriately.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p><em>To make 3 to 4 servings.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(2) apples</li>
      <li>(1) orange</li>
      <li>(1 or 2) bananas</li>
      <li>a bunch of spinach</li>
      <li>(1 or 2) cups of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut your apples into quarters and remove seeds. You may need to cut 
            your apple additionally depending on your blender.</li>
        <li>Peel the skin of your orange. You want to remove the rough skin but 
            try to keep as much of the white portion as possible. Quarter your 
            peeled orange.</li>
        <li>Peel your banana(s).</li>
        <li>Fill your blender with (1) cup of water. Then fill the blender with 
            your spinach.</li>
        <li>Blend your water and spinach mixture.</li>
        <li>Continue powering your blender while adding your quarters of apples 
            and oranges and your bananas. Add items at a rate appropriate for 
            your blender.</li>
        <li>Turn off your blender when all items are blended. Check the 
            consistency. If the consistency is not to your liking, add the 
            additional cup of water and blend for a few more seconds.</li>
      </ol>
