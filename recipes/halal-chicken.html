  <h2>My favorite way to cook chicken and rice.</h2>
  <p>This recipe is fairly low effort but incredibly satisfying. I found this 
      after having tried chicken and rice at a food truck in New York. I 
      wanted to recreate it at home. This recipe in particular is completely 
      copied from <a href="https://www.yourhomebasedmom.com/halal-cart-style-chicken-rice">yourhomebasedmom</a>, 
      and it looks like they copied it from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe">serious eats</a>.
